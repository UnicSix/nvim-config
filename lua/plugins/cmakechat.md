I understand the issue. The default behavior of `cmake-tools.nvim` might not be using the current working directory as returned by `getcwd()`. Let's create a more robust solution that ensures the CMake working directory is set to the current working directory. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Create a function to get the current working directory
2. Set up an autocmd to update the CMake working directory when entering a buffer
3. Modify the `cmake-tools.nvim` setup to use this function

Here's the code to implement this solution:

```lua
local cmake = require('cmake-tools')

-- Function to get the current working directory
local function get_cwd()
  return vim.fn.getcwd()
end

-- Set up cmake-tools with dynamic working directory
cmake.setup({
  cmake_build_directory = "${cwd}/build",
  cmake_generate_options = { "-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1" },
})

-- Function to update CMake working directory
local function update_cmake_cwd()
  local cwd = get_cwd()
  cmake.set_cmake_build_directory(cwd .. "/build")
end

-- Set up autocmd to update CMake working directory when entering a buffer
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufEnter", "DirChanged"}, {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = update_cmake_cwd
})

-- Command to manually update CMake working directory
vim.api.nvim_create_user_command("UpdateCMakeCWD", update_cmake_cwd, {})
```

This solution does the following:
1. We define a `get_cwd()` function that uses `vim.fn.getcwd()` to get the current working directory.
2. We set up `cmake-tools.nvim` with a dynamic build directory using `${cwd}`.
3. We create an `update_cmake_cwd()` function that sets the CMake build directory to `<current_directory>/build`.
4. We set up an autocmd that calls `update_cmake_cwd()` whenever entering a buffer or changing directories.
5. We create a user command `:UpdateCMakeCWD` to manually update the CMake working directory.
Here's the corrected version of the code:

```lua
config = function()
    local cmake = require('cmake-tools')
    local cwd = vim.uv.cwd()
    cmake.setup({
        cmake_build_directory = cwd .. "/out",
        cmake_generate_options = { "-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1" },
    })
    cmake.select_cwd(cwd)
end,
```

Explanation of the changes:

1. The main issue in the original code was that `cmake.select_build_dir()` was being called inside the `setup()` function, which is incorrect. The `setup()` function expects a table of options, not function calls.

2. To set the build directory, we need to use the `cmake_build_directory` option in the setup table.

3. I moved `cmake.select_cwd(cwd)` outside of the `setup()` function call, as it's a separate operation that should be performed after the setup.

4. I corrected the cmake generate option from `-DMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1` to `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1`. The correct flag is `CMAKE_` not `MAKE_`.

5. The `require('cmake-tools')` call was redundant since we already have `local cmake = require('cmake-tools')` at the beginning.

These changes should correctly set both the current working directory and the build directory for cmake-tools.

Suggestions for next steps:
1. Would you like to know more about other configuration options for cmake-tools?
2. Do you need help with any other Neovim plugins or configurations?
3. Are there any specific CMake-related tasks you're trying to accomplish in Neovim?
